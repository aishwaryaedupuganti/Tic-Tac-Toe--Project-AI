<b><H1>Introduction</H1></b>

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. One player plays as "X" and the other player plays as "O". Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square of the grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to get three in a row wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.


<b><H1>Implementation</H1></b>

We are combining algorithms such as the Min-Max algorithm, Alpha-Beta pruning, and Q-learning in this project. The Min-Max algorithm generates a decision tree that represents all possible moves and outcomes. The decision tree can then be pruned using alpha-beta pruning to remove branches that are unlikely to lead to a winning move. Finally, Q-learning can be used to improve AI agent performance by allowing them to learn from their past experiences.
