<b><H1>Introduction</H1></b>

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. One player plays as "X" and the other player plays as "O". Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square of the grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to get three in a row wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.
